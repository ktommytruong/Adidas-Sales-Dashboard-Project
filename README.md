# Adidas-Sales-Dashboard-Project
This is a guided project that I completed by following along [Andy Kriebel's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w4s_6r3B6A&ab_channel=AndyKriebel) youtube tutorial on how to build a tableau dashboard. My personal objective for this project was to gain first hand experience on utilizing Tableau for data visualization. For this project, I used the Adidas sales data from Kaggle. The link to the dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishwas199728/adidas-sales-data).
